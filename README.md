### About
- Building reliable software systems — now applying the same rigor to AI/ML.
- Interested in LLMs, applied ML, data pipelines, and production-grade AI.
- Bias toward clean architecture, measurable results, and shipping.

### Current Focus
- Learning: model training basics, evaluation, deployment, MLOps.
- Building: small projects that prove value end-to-end (data → model → app).
- Exploring: retrieval (RAG), fine-tuning, agents, inference optimization.

### Tech
**Languages & Core**
- Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- SQL

**Systems**
- APIs
- Docker
- Linux
- Git

**AI / ML**
- ML fundamentals
- LLMs

### What I Like Working On
- Tools that automate boring work.
- Systems that are fast, observable, and resilient.
- AI features that actually ship (not demo-only).

### Open To
- Collaborations on practical AI/ML projects.
- Code reviews or pairing on “first real ML project” builds.
- Interesting backend + ML integrations.
